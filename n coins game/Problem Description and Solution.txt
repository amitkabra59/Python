Description:

Given n coins for two players playing a game. 
Each player can pick at least 1 and at most 5 coins in one turn. 
The player who picks the last coin loses the game. 
If they play optimally, which player will win the game?



Solution:

In order to win, you must be able to leave 1 coin at the table which in turn requires you to leave 7 coins at the table which in turn requires you to be able to leave 13 coins on the table and so on…

similar backtracking will give you a series of winning moves as:

1,7,13,19,25,31,37,43,………….6∗k+1

k≥0,k∈N

So if (Number of coins - 1) is a multiple of 6 , the person who starts the game is looser because other guy by default is within the series.

Otherwise the person who starts the game is winner.

Consider one example. Let no.ofcoins=9 . 9–1=8 is not a multiple of 6 hence the person who starts the game wins the game because the starter can remove 1 coin to achieve 7 which is in the series.
